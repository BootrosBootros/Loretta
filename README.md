# Loretta

Loretta is a tool to convert text based information, usually reports in a text only form (think output from a Finance/ERP type system) and convert that into a chunk of tabular data.  It's purpose is to eliminate the manual work required to perform the conversion, in a way that's repeatable (i.e. uses templates that can be re-used on repetative conversions) and can be constructed by non technical users (i.e. someone in the business can do it rather than calling on a tech professional)

Loretta was originally developed in Microsoft Excel as it is a commonly used tool for Finance departments around the world.  The goal is to replace that with a web based version and/or a version that will work in Google Sheets.

The tool was developed originally in roughly 2009/2010 by me, Andrew Boote, as a hobby project to save time in my day job.  It was always developed outside of my work environment as a broad based tool usable in multiple situations, with task/output specific versions developed and "locked down" to convert fixed format outputs (i.e. specific reports) then build and deployed within the business I was working for.
